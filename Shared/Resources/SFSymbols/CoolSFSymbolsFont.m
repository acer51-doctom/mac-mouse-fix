/// This filer offers wrapper methods for interacting with the CoolSFSymbols.otf font which we ship in the Mac Mouse Fix bundle to display SFSymbols inside tooltips.
///
/// CoolSFSymbols.otf is created by a python script in this repo, and then (manually) added as a build file for the Mac Mouse Fix target in Xcode (that means the font file ends up in the bundle after building the app)
///
/// At runtime, methods from this file are called from 2 places: (at the time of writing)
///  - Inside AppDelegate.m, when the app launches or closes the CoolSFSymbols.otf font is registered/unregistered
///  - Inside UIStrings.m, before it returns a unicode character for an SF Symbol, it asks this file whether the unicode character can be displayed - to validate correctness (only happens for debug builds.)
///
/// Also see:
/// - Discussion on this GitHub pull request by @groverlynn, which motivated and informed the new approach where we ship CoolSFSymbols.otf with the app: https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/pull/385
/// - The notes in the python script that generates CoolSFSymbols.otf - explains some more of the ideas and stuff.
